# Receives the player data from predictor agent, if it needs intervention

# INPUT: 
# - High-Risk player profile (type, references, LTV, bankroll)
# - Past intervention history (what worked/failed before)
# - Churn signals (tilting, losing streak, engagement drop)
# - Budget constraints (max intervention cost vs player LTV)
